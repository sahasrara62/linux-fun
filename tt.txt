sudo is probably the most used command in Ubuntu.

In this post, I will show you how to make ‘sudo’ display funny and humorous error messages in Ubuntu Linux.

To do that, you would only need to edit the /etc/sudoers :

sudo nano /etc/sudoers

Then find the line that starts with Defaults env_reset, add insults at the end of the line so it would look like this:

# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file
#
Defaults env_reset, insults

Save the file, and you are done! You can test the results by running the sudo command and entering the wrong password.
